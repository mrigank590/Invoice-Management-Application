# Invoice Management Application

## Business Overview

In the B2B (Business-to-Business) world, businesses engage with other businesses on credit terms. When a buyer places an order with a seller, the seller issues an invoice containing details of the goods purchased and the payment terms. This is known as "Accounts Receivable" in accounting terminology.

The objective of the Tech Track project is to develop an AI-Enabled FinTech B2B Invoice Management Application using Java and React-Js. This application aims to streamline invoice management for businesses by providing features such as credit validation, order verification, inventory check, and predicting order amounts.
